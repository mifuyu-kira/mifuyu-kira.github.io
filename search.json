This paper examines the effectiveness of recent disability employment quota systems by exploiting discontinuous increases in quotas based on firm size. The results show that while quotas do increase employment of persons with disabilities, the effect is limited. Each additional worker in the quota requirement increases only 0.3 additional persons with disabilities employed. Also, there are heterogeneous impacts across industry sectors. These findings contribute to discussions about policy directions for advancing disability employment in the future.\n\n\nPeer Effect in a Flipped Classroom: Field Experiments (joint with )\n\n\nRecent Presentations\n\nJan 10, 2025\n\nWorkshop on the economics of human resource allocation (online)\n\nNov 19, 2024\n\nJapanese Economic Association Fall Meeting (Fukuoka, Japan)"
