I am Mifuyu Kira / 吉良光冬 (in Japanese), a PhD student in Public Policy at the University of Osaka [(OSIPP)](https://www.osipp.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/) from 2024.


My reseach focus is on labour, education, and applied microeconomics using observational data and experimental methods. 
<br>I am primarily interested in the topics of disability and redistribution.

Before my PhD, I received an MA in Economics from the [University of Tokyo](https://www.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-e.html).

<div style="text-align: justify">
Promoting employment opportunities for persons with disabilities is an essential policy for social inclusion. This paper examines the effectiveness of recent disability employment quota systems by exploiting discontinuous increases in quotas based on firm size. The results show that while quotas do increase employment of persons with disabilities, the effect is limited. Each additional worker in the quota requirement increases only 0.3 additional persons with disabilities employed. Also, there are heterogeneous impacts across industry sectors. These findings contribute to discussions about policy directions for advancing disability employment in the future.
